Overall Assumptions
- Trainers manage their schedule and set when theyâ€™re available, admins use this info to book classes, members use this schedule to book
- Assume that logging in is done without password
- Assume that payment is done without credit card
- Assume that trainers and admins cannot register as this was not specified in the specifications
- Assume there are no refunds
- Assume there is no need for members to deregister from group classes as it was not specified in the specs
- Assume a member profile when searched by a trainer is their info, fitness goals, and health metrics
- Assume that once a fitness goal is complete it becomes a fitness achievements

This database is designed to hold all of the required information to keep track of for a fitness app. The app has three types of users: members, trainers, and admins.

Our program can do everything listed in the problem statement and required functions

Assumptions for database design
- Most things are self explanatory or talked about in video
- Assume members don't need to have group_fitness, pt_session, exercises, achievements, fitness_goals, health_metrics, bills, but all of those need a member
- Assume members can have multiple of all those things, and all those things can have 1 member (except for group_fitness)
- Assume all pt_sessions, group_fitness, and available_times (schedule) have a trainer, but not every trainer has one of those
- Assume those things have one trainer apiece, whereas trainers can have multiple of those
- Assume one payment has one bill and vice versa, assume all payments have a bill, but not all bills have a payment
- Assume all room_bookings need a room, but not all rooms need a room_bookings
- Assume each room_booking has one room, but each room can have many room bookings
- Assumed admins aren't really related to anything in database
- Assumed equipments aren't really related to anything in database
